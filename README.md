Freshman

Hi there!

I'm a freshman in coding.
I'm here to try to find some help, and...also try to learn the others' API or coding style.
Everything here makes me very curious, and I want to start reading API immidiately, but the internet speed is too tough to signin everytime, that's a quite good start...

It's my first file in my first branch if that MASTER is not the first one, so I hope everyone can help me to learn coding or programming and I can help the others too someday.

Thanks.
